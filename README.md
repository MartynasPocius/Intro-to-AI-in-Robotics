# Intro-to-AI-in-Robotics

Welcome to the "Introduction to AI in Robotics" tutorial series!

## Syllabus

1. Phase 1: Obstacle Avoidance Robot
   - Lesson 1: Common Structure
   - Lesson 2: Microcontrollers and Arduino Uno
   - Lesson 3: Arduino programming
   - Lesson 4: Actuators and Sensors
   - Lesson : Putting everything together
2. Phase 2: Maze solving Robot
3. Phase 3: Introduction to Webots simulation software
4. Phases 4-7: Webots: Project Breakdown

## Equipment

In the normal setting, the tutorial series would require physical components. Due to the current pandemic situation, however, learners without bot kits are not going to be disadvantaged, as the practical part for the Phases 1-2 can be completed with Tinkercad circuit simulator. 
Although, having physical kits are encouraged.
