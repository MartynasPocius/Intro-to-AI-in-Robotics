# Lesson 1: Basic Electronics



<It might be usefull to have a general introduction talking what are robots and general stuff>


Before diving straigt into the world of robotics, we should first familiarize ourselves with the some general electronics principles. On the other hand, an extensive knowledge of electrical components isn't essential, as most of the times, we put more focus on the application of a certain component.

Without any further or do let's start by first analyzing our parts list.

| Part | What it does? |
| --- | --- |
| Arduino Uno | It serves as the *'brain'* of our robot |
| Motor shield | Responsible for distributing power across the motors |
| Chassis | The basis on which we built our robot |
| DC motor | Responsible for the movement of our wheeled bot |
| Servo motor | Motor able to turn at precise angle |
| Ultrasonic sensor | It uses ultrasound to measure the distance from the object|
| IR sensor | Uses IR to measure the distance from the object |
| 9V battery | Provides power to our bot |

As we made a general overview of the components, not it's time to discuss some of them more in depth.
