<h1> Lesson 03: Arduino Programming </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

In this lesson, we'll have a look at how to write the program for the Arduino board using both the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and TinkerCAD. 
The lesson will cover: 
<ul>
  <li> an overview of both interfaces </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Arduino IDE </li>
    <li>TinkerCAD</li>
  </ul>
<li> the basic syntax of the code </li>
  <ul>
    <li>void setup() and void loop()</li>
    <li>some useful programming tips</li>
    <li>defining pins</li>
  </ul>
<li> explanation of simple examples with more to try</li>
</ul>


As mentioned at the end of the previous lesson, Arduino programming is based on the the C/C++ language, however you don’t need any prior experience of this to learn how to program an Arduino. 

To start off, we’ll look at the Arduino IDE interface and how it’s replicated in TinkerCAD.  

<h2>Arduino IDE</h2>

The Arduino IDE is a software used to write and upload code to the physical board (the microcontroller introduced in Lesson 01). 

The Arduino IDE can be downloaded from the Arduino website  <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank">here</a> and you’ll find all the instructions to do this for your operating system. It is completely free and open-source and can be used with any Arduino board, not just the Arduino Uno we’ll be using.

Once you’ve got this downloaded and opened, the interface that you’ll see will look something like this.
